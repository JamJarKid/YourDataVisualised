# YourDataV

You can obtain your historical google location data from https://takeout.google.com, this repo gives four easy functions to parse your location data into a pandas DataFrame and plot it onto a google map webpage.

The module used to plot the data is [gmplot](https://pypi.org/project/gmplot/), the functions in this module simply call the gmplot functions. Due to the simplicity of the functions in this repo, some customisability of the plot is removed.
